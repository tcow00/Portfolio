    "description": "Before realizing my passion for creative writing, I enjoyed a summer of reporting at the Columbia Missourian during the summer of 2020. This summer posed a unique set of challenges. The first challenge was transitioning all newspaper operations to a fully virtual work environment, while publishing a daily print and online edition. The second challenge was on-the-ground reporting during a summer of pandemic restrictions and civil unrest.",

    "description": "This campaign spanned 4 social media platforms (instagram, twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook), with a a hybrid paid and organic media strategy. The goal? Garner interest for the annual 'State of The YAYA Report.' As lead copywriter, I played an integral role in the development of the campaign story, social media copy, print report, and presentation + script. To attract the distracted eyes and content preferences of Gen Z, our campaign personified that mysterious, macabre feel that's in-tune with Gen Z's horror genre fascination.",
